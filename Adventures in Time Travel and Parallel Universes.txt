I should have known it was too good to be true when I found a brand new smartphone, still in its packaging, smack in the middle of my hotel room bed when I checked in. I mean, I assumed it was a mistake, that someone had left it behind. Yeah, it was strange that the phone would be sitting on top of a freshly-made hotel bed, which the housekeeping staff had obviously cleaned up since the last guest had checked out. I wondered why they hadn't turned in the item to the hotel's lost and found, or if they were dishonest, taken it home and kept it. 

Moments after I deposited my luggage on the floor, I took a closer look at the phone and noticed that there was small piece of card stock, about the size of a business card, tucked partially under the smartphone box. I picked up the card and examined it. In the center of it, in typewritten letters, was my name. The card was otherwise blank. I wondered if the hotel had left this phone for me as a mistake, if someone had asked the hotel staff to leave it in the room of another guest and there had been a mixup. Then a small thrill leapt through me: could one of the conference organizers have left this for me as a thank-you gift for agreeing to give a presentation? Almost as quickly as the thought entered my mind I dismissed it as ridiculous; I had never heard of such a practice at any conference. I called the hotel front desk (using the room's phone), and told the lady on the other end about the unopened mobile phone left on my bed.

"I'm sorry, sir, what did you say is on your bed?"

"There's an unopened smartphone. I'm surprised the cleaning staff left it here."

"One moment, sir..." From the other end of the line I heard the clicking of a computer keyboard. "Sir, I don't see any notes about anyone reporting a lost cell phone, or any notes from the housekeeping staff about a phone that was left in any rooms."

"Should I bring it down to the lobby in case someone comes looking for it?"

More typing from the other end of the line. "Sir, anything in your room at check-in comes compliments of the hotel. No need to bring anything down here. Thank you for checking." Click. The line went dead. 

I thought about calling back, but something made me hesitate. Why had there been a card with my name printed on it, directly beneath the phone? There must have been a reason. Maybe the phone really was intended for me. It could have been some sort of surprise someone planned. I wasn't sure who would have done that, other than the conference organizers, or maybe my employer. Neither seemed like a particularly likely explanation, though. 

I held up the box and looked at it more closely. The picture of the phone printed on the box showed a typical touch screen device, though it was not a model I recognized. In hindsight, I realize I should have been more suspicious; I follow a lot of technology blogs, and I usually hear about most phone models before they come on the market. The box had the word "Sidrat" printed directly above the picture of the phone. What an unfortunate name! It sounded like a name for an animated rodent. At first I assumed it was the name of the phone model, but as I looked at the box and noticed the lack of any other text, I wondered if it were the name of the manufacturer. 

I stared at the box and contemplated whether or not to take it down to the hotel front desk anyway. Finally I came to a decision. I had to try out this phone. It seemed to have been left for me, right? Maybe this was a prototype that the conference organizers or my employer gave me to try out, so that I could write up a preview of it, or work it into my conference presentation. I was dying to know what it was like, and how it differed from the other models I'd seen recently. I tore off the shrink wrap, and pulled the lid off the box.

Inside was a typical glass brick style phone, surrounded by cardboard packaging. That's all there was inside. I lifted the phone out of the box, expecting to find a small manual, or maybe some accessories, beneath it. Nothing. Not even a power cord. Just the phone. How odd. This must be some sort of prototype. Why in the world wouldn't it have a power cord, though? How long would the batteries last before it needed a recharge? It made no sense to me. I turned the phone over in my hand, examining every surface. I only saw one button on it, at the very bottom of the front surface. After turning it over several times to make sure there were no other controls, I tapped the sole button. The screen lit up immediately, and on the display a few icons appeared. I tapped one that looked like a camera. 

A flash of light blinded me temporarily. After blinking a few times, I looked down at the phone to see the photo I had just taken, but the screen displayed two buttons: "Save" and "Discard." I tapped "Save," and a text field appeared with the prompt, "Enter message." I guess I had to give the photo a caption. I entered "My hotel room." Then I was back on the home screen again, with all the icons. Did this piece of junk app just crash? I hoped this was indeed a prototype, otherwise it was a major letdown. Here I had gotten all excited about a mysterious new phone left for me in my hotel room. 

Out of curiosity I tapped an icon with a tee on it, wondering what kind of app would open. A drawing of a tree appeared in the background of the screen, with a bunch of colored lines superimposed on top of the tree branches. I tapped a tree branch labeled "Prank-call." 

My stomach jumped, like I was going down a roller coaster. What? Why did I just get a butterfly feeling? I looked at the app. The only change I could see was that the Prank-call tree branch was glowing slightly. How boring. It was time to put away this worthless glass brick and practice my conference presentation, or maybe run up a tab at the hotel bar.

I was about to drop the phone onto the bed when it started ringing. Enough was enough. I couldn't take this phone or this call too seriously anymore; it was all too weird. I tapped the button the answer the phone, and said, "Geppetto's Pizza, how may I help you?"

"You have figured out how to change branches, now it is time for the next step..." The voice, barely more than a whisper, had a scratchy, metallic quality, as if it were traveling halfway around the world over aging copper wires.

"I'm sorry, sir, this is the only branch of Geppetto's Pizza, we don't have any other locations at this time. But, we deliver all over the city. Would you like to try one of our new gluten-free pizzas?"

"I know who you are...there is not need to waste time...you must learn to use the phone..."

"I'm sorry, sir, but I already know how to use a phone, I'm doing it right now. If you don't like pizza, we also have a selection of garden-fresh salads."

"Learn to use this phone...the Sidrat phone...there is a clue down the hall, by the ice machine..."

Well, the pizza joke wasn't working on this guy. Time for a different tactic. "Fine, enough joking around. Yes, I got the phone you left me in my hotel room. Did you get the toothbrush I left in yours?"

"You must go find the clue near the ice machine..."

This guy obviously had no sense of humor. I felt like I was talking with a robot. Maybe I was. I hung up the phone and dropped it on the bedside table. As I did so, my thumb slipped and brushed the camera icon on the phone. The phone flashed.
